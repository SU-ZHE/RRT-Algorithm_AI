Topic：Research on autonomous exploration path planning based on RRT algorithm
Abstract：In general, efficient robot navigation requires predefined maps. With the development of computers, various autonomous exploration strategies are currently available, allowing robots to autonomously detect boundaries and plan paths to explore unknown environments. Boundaries refer to the lines that separate known spaces from unknown spaces. Typically, frontier detection utilizes image processing tools like edge detection, which confines it to two-dimensional (2D) exploration. This project employs an exploration strategy based on multiple Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The RRT algorithm was chosen because it has significant advantages in exploring unknown environments. Furthermore, the RRT algorithm offers a universal approach that can be extended to higher-dimensional spaces. Due to time constraints, the strategy used is implemented only in a Python environment. Additionally, this project utilizes local and global trees to detect boundary points, thereby achieving efficient robot exploration. Currently, this project is limited to the case of a single robot. Extending it to multi-agent systems and three-dimensional (3D) space is left for future work.
